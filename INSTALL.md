## 🆚 Comparison with Standard Neutralinojs

| Feature | Standard npm install | This Repository |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Installation | `npm i -g @neutralinojs/neu` | Build from source |
| Shutdown Time | Variable (sometimes infinite) | **7ms average** |
| Signal Handling | Basic | **Enhanced with timeouts** |
| Memory Cleanup | Partial | **Complete cleanup sequence** |
| Process Management | Manual | **Automatic tracking** |

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start for Existing Projects

Replace your existing Neutralino executable:

```cmd
# Backup your current executable
